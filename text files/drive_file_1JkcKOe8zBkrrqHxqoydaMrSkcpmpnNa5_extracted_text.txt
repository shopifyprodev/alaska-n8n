September 11, 2024 Abbreviated Plat Hearing Packet 6 of 79 Add plat note: “Single access each to Clark-Wolverine Road for Basic 1 and Basic 3.” (See Recommendation #4) DOT&PF cannot guarantee permittable access for Basic 1 to Clark-Wolverine Road due to the curvature of the road geometry and site distance requirements. Suggest Basic 1 access through Basic 2 to Robin Lane and formalize with an access easement. If Basic 1 accesses Clark-Wolverine Road, DOT&PF suggests Basic 1 development not preclude possible local road interconnectivity to Clark-Wolverine Road. DOT&PF recommends dedicating a road to provide interconnectivity. Staff notes dedications cannot be required through the abbreviated plat process. No additional access points to the Old Glenn Highway or Clark-Wolverine Road will be permitted for Basic 2. Future circulation for Basic 2 required to be through Robin Lane. Future Basic 2 access to the Old Glenn Highway may become right in and right out only. Future Basic 2 access to the Old Glenn Highway may be revoked due to safety concerns along the Old Glenn Highway. This would require access along the Old Glenn Highway alignment through Robin Lane only. All utility access for Basic 1, 2 and 3 through existing driveway and access points. No additional utility connections through Old Glenn Highway or Clark-Wolverine Road right of way. Subsequent development requires utility access to continue through existing access points. Platting actions invalidate existing driveway permits. Reapply for driveway permits for Basic 1, 2 and 3 access to Clark-Wolverine Road and the Old Glenn Highway. Driveway permits and Approach Road Review can be applied for at DOT&PF’s online ePermits website: https://dot.alaska.gov/row/Login.po. Please contact DOT&PF’s ROW division at 1-800-770-5263 to speak with a regional permit officer if you have any questions. MBS Pre-Design and Engineering: Coordinate with AKDOT for access onto Clark Wolverine Road. PD&E recommends no new access onto Clark Wolverine or the Old Glenn Hwy. Utilities: (Exhibit F) GCI has no comments or objections. ENSTAR has no comments or recommendations. MTA and MEA did not respond. Public: (Exhibit H) Patricia Gray has no objection. Mark Hansen has no objection. At the time of staff report write-up, there were no responses to the Request for Comments from ADF&G; Lazy Mountain Community Council; Fire Service Area #132 Greater Palmer Consolidated; Road Service Area #19 Lazy Mountain; MSB Emergency Services, Community Development, Planning Division or Assessments; MTA or MEA. CONCLUSION: The preliminary plat of BUSH ESTATES is consistent with AS 29.40.070 Platting Regulations and MSB 43.15.025 Abbreviated Plats. There were no objections from any federal or state agencies, Borough departments, or utilities. There were no objections to the plat from the public in response to the Notice of Public Hearing; Legal and physical access exists to the proposed lots, consistent with MSB 43.20.100 Access Required, MSB 43.20.120 Legal Access and MSB 43.20.140 Physical Access. Pursuant to MSB 43.20.281(A)(1), a soils report was submitted. Bush Estates Page 2 of 3 2024-098 09/11/2024
