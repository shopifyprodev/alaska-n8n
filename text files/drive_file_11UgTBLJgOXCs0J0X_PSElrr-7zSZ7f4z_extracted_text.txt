The project will create one new lot and two large tracts from one existing parent parcel totaling 40 acres. Our soils evaluation included logging one new testhole on the parent parcel, review of adjacent existing soils information, review of the provided topography information, review of aerial imagery, and our other observations at the site. See the attached testhole location and topography map for details. Topography. The project site forms a square shape west of the north-south section of W. Cormorant Way. The entire parent parcel has gently rolling terrain, with a minimal slope generally directed southward or to the southeast; the lowest areas are along the south border and near the east border center. Numerous minor areas with steep slopes over 25% exist, and one substantial area near the east half center. Steep areas are delineated on the attached map. The total elevation differential indicated from the provided topographical map is approximately 64’. Soils & Vegetation. The parent parcel remains largely undeveloped, with the exception of the southeast quarter which has 3 developed home sites. Other areas appear to remain in a native or near native state. Existing vegetation in the wooded portion primarily consists of mature growth birch and spruce trees. A new testhole was dug on 1/11/24 to evaluate existing soil conditions. Near surface soils encountered in the testholes included a thin organic mat over a layer of silty loess topsoils which extended down to 1.3’. Receiving soils under the topsoils were consistently found to be relatively dense silty sands and gravels. A sieve test returned a silt content of 32%. Soils encountered were typical for the area, based on existing neighboring soils information and from our prior experiences on adjacent properties. A copy of the on-project testhole log and a location/topography map is attached. 7/25/2024 24013A Soils p.1 /2 EXHIBIT B-(

~ September 11,-2024 Abbreviated Plat Hearing Packet . i) (4 67 of 79 Groundwater. Groundwater was not encountered in the new testhole, which was dug to , ‘ 16’. Groundwater is not expected to be a limiting factor for useable area for the proposed lot and tracts. Useable Areas. The proposed lots have a few limitations on areas defined by MSB code as useable septic area or useable building area. Useable septic areas will be primarily limited by setbacks to water wells, steep areas and related setbacks, and lot lines. For useable building area, lotlines and setbacks, and ROW/PUE setbacks will be limiting factors. For the proposed lots, adequate unencumbered area exists to readily meet the code requirements. Based on the available soils and water table information, topography, MSB Title 43 Code definitions, and our observations at the site, proposed Lot 1 will contain over 10,000 square feet of contiguous useable septic area, and an additional 10,000 square feet of useable building area. The proposed Tract A and B are each over 400,000 square feet and not subject to area verification. Please do not hesitate to call with any questions you may have.

September 11, 2024 Abbreviated Plat Hearing Packet 71 of 79 Chris Curlin = SSS From: Farrer, Hayley M CIV USARMY CEPOA (USA) <Hayley.M.Farrer@usace.army.mil> Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2024 6:02 AM To: Chris Curlin Subject: [Non-DoD Source] RFC Polaris View (CC) [EXTERNAL EMAIL - CAUTION: Do not open unexpected attachments or links.] Good morning, The Corps of Engineers (Corps) does not have any specific comments regarding Polaris View platting action. Department of the Army authorization is required if anyone proposes to place dredged and/or fill material into waters of the U.S., including wetlands and/or perform work in navigable waters of the U.S. A copy of the DA permit application can be found online at www.poa.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory. Sample drawings can also be found on our website at Www.poa.usace.army.mil/Portals/34/docs/regulatory/guidetodrawings2012.pdf. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires that a DA permit be obtained for the placement or discharge of dredged and/or fill material into waters of the U.S., including jurisdictional wetlands (33 U.S.C. 1344). The Corps defines wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 requires that a DA permit be obtained for structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the U.S. (33 U.S.C. 403). Section 10 waters are those waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to the mean high water mark, and/or other waters identified by the Alaska District. Aquaculture structures and work would require Section 10 Authorization. The property owner is welcome to submit a preapplication meeting request, a jurisdictional determination request, or a permit application directly to our general mailbox (regnagemaster@usace.army.mil) and you will be assigned a project manager to assist you. Please feel free to contact our main line if you or the property owner have any questions or concerns at 907-753-2712. Sincerely, Hayley Farrer Regulatory Specialist South Section, Alaska District US Army Corps of Engineers Office: (907)753-2778 Cell: (907)687-1059 Streamline the permitting process with the REGULATORY __ Regulatory Request System (RRS) — your new REQUEST | online platform for permit applications trey SYSTEM rrs.usace.army.mil 1 EXHIBIT C
