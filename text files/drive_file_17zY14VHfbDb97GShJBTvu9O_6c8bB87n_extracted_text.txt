BOX 876390 =WASILLA,AK. 99687 PHONE: 373-6996 FAX: 373-5996 Reference: Bush Estates Date: 08-05-2024 Subject: Topographic Narrative To: MSB Platting Landforms: Topography for Section 35, T18N, RO2ZE, Seward Meridian, Alaska. It is described as uplands, with the Matanuska River flowing over the southwest corner of section 35. The elevation ranges from 180 feet above sea level in the southwest corner to 600 feet above sea level in the northeast corner. The soil ranges from gravel with sand and sandy silt. The land is mostly forested with Birch, Spruce, and Cottonwood trees, with some areas having dense undergrowth. Hydrology: The Matanuska River is the dominant hydraulic feature in the area. For decades, erosion by the glacial braided river has damaged roads, farms, and houses. Current Usage: Section 35 is occupied by human development today. The area is divided into one-acre parcels and up to forty-acre parcels, with mixed land uses ranging from farming to single- family dwellings. Attachment A is a screenshot from the MSB parcel viewer with 2022 imagery and 2019 contours.

DUNLEAVY - is 7 pe Seas poe or ain: 907-269-0520 Fax: 907-269-052 dot.alaska.gov August 22, 2024 Fred Wagner, Platting Officer Matanuska-Susitna Borough 350 East Dahlia Avenue Palmer, AK 99645 [Sent Electronically] Re: Plat Review Dear Mr. Wagner: The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF) Central Region has reviewed the following plats and have the following comments: e Bush Estates (Old Glenn Highway, Clark-Wolverine Road) o No objection to the proposed lot division. o Basic | will be permitted one singular access to Clark-Wolverine Road. Subsequent development of Basic | requires continued use of singular access to Clark- Wolverine Road. Please plan internal circulation accordingly. o Basic 3 will be permitted one singular access to Clark-Wolverine Road. No additional access points will be permitted. o Add plat note: “Single access each to Clark-Wolverine Road for Basic | and Basic 3.” o DOT&PF cannot guarantee permittable access for Basic 1 to Clark-Wolverine Road due to the curvature of the road geometry and site distance requirements. Suggest Basic | access through Basic 2 to Robin Lane and formalize with an access easement. o IfBasic 1 accesses Clark-Wolverine Road, DOT&PF suggests Basic | development not preclude possible local road interconnectivity to Clark-Wolverine Road. DOT&PF recommends dedicating a road to provide interconnectivity. A possible alignment is shown in the below diagram: EXHIBIT C ~!

Future circulation for Basic 2 required to be through Robin Lane. o Future Basic 2 access to the Old Glenn Highway may become right in and right out only. o Future Basic 2 access to the Old Glenn Highway may be revoked due to safety concerns along the Old Glenn Highway. This would require access along the Old Glenn Highway alignment through Robin Lane only. o Allutility access for Basic 1, 2 and 3 through existing driveway and access points. No additional utility connections through Old Glenn Highway or Clark-Wolverine Road right of way. Subsequent development requires utility access to continue through existing access points. © Platting actions invalidate existing driveway permits. Reapply for driveway permits for Basic 1, 2 and 3 access to Clark- Wolverine Road and the Old Glenn Highway. Driveway permits and Approach Road Review can be applied for at DOT&PF’s online ePermits website: https://dot.alaska.gov/row/Login.po. Please contact DOT&PF’s ROW division at 1-800-770-5263 to speak with a regional permit officer if you have any questions. All properties accessing DOT&PF roads must apply to Right of Way for a driveway permit and/or approach road review, subject to provisions listed in 17 AAC 10.020. Any previously issued access permits become invalid once the property undergoes a platting action and must be reissued. We recommend the petitioner verify all section line easements and DOT&PF road rights-of-way adjacent to their property. For assistance, the petitioner may contact the Engineering group within the Right of Way section in DOT&PF at (907) 269-0700. The petitioner is liable to remove any improvements within the easements and rights-of-way that impede the operation and maintenance of those facilities even if they are not shown on the plat, so it is in the petitioner’s best interest to identify the exact locations and widths of any such easements or rights-of-way before they improve the property. If any section line easements or road rights-of-way exist within the bounds of their plat, we recommend the petitioner dedicate them. If there is an existing right-of-way or easement, the petitioner is unable to EXHIBIT C -2
